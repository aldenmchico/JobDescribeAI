# JobDescribe.ai
JobDescribe.ai is a web-tool that generates job descriptions powered by OpenAI's API. To use JobDescribe.ai, the user simply enters a career field that they're interested in and a US state as a location, and JobDescribe.ai generates information related to the job and location that the user entered. Information such as day-to-day job descriptions, relavent job skills, job listing websites, educational requirements, and educational institutions are all generated in real-time using OpenAI to produce useful information that the user can utilize for their situational awareness.

JobDescribe.ai is a personal project that I created to learn more about how OpenAI can be used to integrate into my future personal projects and I hope by making the project open source, others can learn how they can use OpenAI for their projects as well.
